   #
   # Setting an attribute of the theme object just propagates the
   # value to the respective attribute of the tiling and the floating
   # object. IF THE TITLE AREA IS DIVIDED INTO TABS, THEN THE NOT
   # SELECTED TABS CAN BE STYLED USING THE TAB_... ATTRIBUTES. If
   # these attributes are empty, then the colors are taken from the
   # theme of the client to which the tab refers to.
