# The order of those commands matters.  Maybe I will write something
# more sophisticated in the future.

# Part of my dotfiles: <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/dotfiles>.

# This is imperfect, but add the "coach" tag to any message that
# includes those keywords in the subject line.  The starting date is
# the one I made the announcement:
# <https://protesilaos.com/news/2023-01-20-emacs-linux-life-coach/>.
# I may refine this further based on patterns I observe.
