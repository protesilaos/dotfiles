### Commentary:
#
# Note that the order of those commands matters.
#
# Part of my dotfiles: <https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.

### Code:

# remove "unread" from "replied"
notmuch tag -unread -new -- tag:replied

# tag all "new" messages "inbox" and "unread"
notmuch tag +inbox +unread -new -- tag:new

# tag my replies as "sent"
# notmuch tag -new -unread +inbox +sent -- '(from:"*@protesilaos.com*" not to:"*@protesilaos.com*" not tag:list)'
notmuch tag -new -unread +inbox +sent -- '(from:"*@protesilaos.com*" not to:"*@protesilaos.com*" not tag:list not tag:archived)'

# This is imperfect, but add the "coach" tag to any message that
# includes those keywords in the subject line.  The starting date is
# the one I made the announcement:
# <https://protesilaos.com/news/2023-01-20-emacs-linux-life-coach/>.
# I may refine this further based on patterns I observe.
notmuch tag +coach -- date:2023-01-20..now subject:/[Tt]utor\|[Cc]oach\|[Ll]esson/

# Another "mostly okay" but not 100% correct way of identifying my
# package-related messages.
notmuch tag +package -- "(to:protesilaos/*noreply.github.com or to:*incoming.gitlab.com) not tag:archived not tag:list"
