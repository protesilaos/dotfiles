! These settings have been implemented successfully on Debian 10
! 'buster' running a variety of desktop environments on top of Xorg.

! To get the current status of the modifiers:
!
!    xmodmap -pm
!
! To find out the key codes that are available:
!
!    xmodmap -pke
!
! Or narrow the results, e.g.:
!
!    xmodmap -pke | grep -E '(Alt|Shift)'
!
! Alternatively, use `xev` to print the key code upon key press.
!
! Here are some of the most likely candidates for changes:
!
!    keycode 37  = Control_L
!    keycode 50  = Shift_L
!    keycode 62  = Shift_R
!    keycode 64  = Alt_L
!    keycode 66  = Caps_Lock
!    keycode 77  = Num_Lock
!    keycode 105 = Control_R
!    keycode 108 = Alt_R
!    keycode 133 = Super_L
!    keycode 134 = Super_R
!    keycode 135 = Menu
