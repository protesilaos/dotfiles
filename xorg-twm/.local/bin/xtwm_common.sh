### Commentary:
#
# Common settings used by my BSPWM and Herbstluftwm setups
# (collectively referred to as "Xorg Tiling Window Managers").  I
# configure those window managers to be similar.
#
# In all cases where a file is called, I assume it exists.
#
# Part of my dotfiles: <https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.

### Code:

_check ()
{
    command -v "$1" > /dev/null
}

# Specify keyboard layout options.  See the setxkbmap(1) manual for
# the command line arguments and the xkeyboard-config(7) manual for
# the layout names and options.
#
# NOTE 2023-07-16: The -option used to accept a comma separated list.
# Now it requires each option to be specified separately.
#
# NOTE 2023-07-16: The Greek layout used to be called 'el' but now is
# 'gr'.
if _check setxkbmap
then
    # setxkbmap -layout 'us,gr' -option '' -option 'ctrl:nocaps' \
    #           -option 'altwin:menu_win' -option 'caps:none' \
    #           -option 'compose:ins' -option 'grp:win_space_toggle'

# The hotkey daemon that handles all custom key bindings.  I split the
# key chords into separate files, based on their scope.  The ones that
# pertain to the window manager are defined in sxhkdrc_bspwm and
# sxhkdrc_herbstluftwm, respectively.
_check sxhkd && sxhkd -c "$HOME"/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc{,_"$DESKTOP_SESSION"} &

# Launch Polybar
if _check polybar
then
    # Make sure we have no running instances
    pkill -x polybar

    # I name my bars after the bspwm or herbstluftwm sessions, so I
    # launch the one I need by getting the relevant environment
    # variable.
    polybar -rq "$DESKTOP_SESSION" &
fi

# Run the tool that sets the wallpaper.  A program could be used that
# handles the desktop in general, including the option to set icons.
# But this is enough for my case.  Here is a command I tested and which
# works (using the Xfce desktop manager):
# xfdesktop --sm-client-disable --disable-wm-check &

## NOTE 2023-01-19: I added the `--backend glx`.  Maybe this is
## better?  I will see it in action when I get the chance.

# FIXME 2021-12-05: It create artifacts while streaming/recording
# video whenever I scroll in Emacs.

# Start the display compositor.  See `picom --help'.
