# SXHKD module with WM-agnostic keys
#
# Part of my dotfiles: <https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
#

### Description
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to
# work with `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed
# with GNU Stow.  See https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

mod4 + e ; s
    pkill -USR1 -x sxhkd && notify-send -i key_bindings "Reloaded key bindings"

mod4 + F5
    delight.sh

mod4 + e ; d ; {q,Q,c,h}
    dunstctl {close,close-all,context,history-pop}
