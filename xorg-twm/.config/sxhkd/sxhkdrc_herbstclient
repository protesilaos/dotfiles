# SXHKD module with HerbstluftWM-specific commands

### Description

# work with `herbstclient`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are
# managed with GNU Stow.  See https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/dotfiles

### Code

# Close currently focused window.  mod4+q closes the frame if no
# window is present.  With shift it closes the frame of the last
# window while it closes that.  With mod4+alt+q remove the frame and
# merge its windows with the closest neighbouring frame.
mod4 + {_, shift +, alt+} q
