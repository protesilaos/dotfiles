;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up the essentials for incorporating my init org
;; file.  This is known as "literate programming", which I think is
;; particularly helpful for sharing Emacs configurations with a wider
;; audience that includes new or potential users (I am still very new
;; myself).
;;
;; See my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

;;; Code:

(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

(require 'vc)
(setq vc-follow-symlinks t) ; Because my dotfiles are managed that way

;; For my custom libraries
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "prot-lisp/"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "themes/"))

;; I create an "el" version of my Org configuration file as a final step
;; before closing down Emacs.  This is done to load the latest version
;; of my code upon startup.
;;
;; Also helps with initialisation times.  Not that I care too much about
;; those… Hence why I no longer bother with deferring package loading
;; either by default or on a case-by-case basis.
(let* ((conf (concat user-emacs-directory "emacs-init"))
       (el (concat conf ".el"))
       (org (concat conf ".org")))
  (if (file-exists-p el)
      (load-file el)
    (require 'org)
    (org-babel-load-file org)))

;;; init.el ends here
