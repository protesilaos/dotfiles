## Description
#
# Use ANSI codes to apply theme change to all active terminals.  This is
# particularly useful for programs that source their colours at startup,
# requiring a restart to apply a new theme.  All terminals I have tested
# respond to the live theme change.  Tried with xterm, rxvt-unicode,
# {gnome,mate,xfce4}-terminal, kitty, tilix.
#
# The ANSI escape sequences are defined in this document
# http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/doc/rxvt.7.pod#XTerm_Operating_System_Commands

[ -n "$xrdb_col" ] || { echo "ERROR: no xrdb colours."; exit 1; }

# Extract only the colour value of the item passed as an argument.
#
# Normally each line looks like:
#   xterm*color10:  #315b00
# It becomes:
#   #315b00
# NOTE we pass `-w` to `grep` to make sure it matches only whole words.
# Otherwise a 'foreground' would also capture 'foregroundalt'.

# be creating the sequence and then pass it to all running terminals, to
# update their corresponding colours.
