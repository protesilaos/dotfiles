# FIXME 2021-10-06: Neither of the following methods works when the
# focus a single node and toggle the monocle layout, because apparently
# the 'bspc subscribe report' does not get updated.  Same for when we
# have two nodes in monocle view and close the one: in that scenario we
# would expect the single node to not count as being in a monocle layout
# given 'bspc config single_monocle true'.

### Approach 1

_layout ()
{
    bspc query -T -d | sed 's,.*userLayout":"\(tiled\|monocle\)".*,\1,'
}

while read -r
do
    case "$(_layout)" in
        monocle) echo "M" ;;
        *) echo "" ;;
    esac
done < <(bspc subscribe report)

### Approach 2

# _single_monocle ()
# {
#     bspc config single_monocle
# }
# 
# while read -r line
# do
#     case $line in
#         *LM*)
#             if [ "$(bspc query -N -d any.focused | wc -l)" -eq 1 ] && [ "$(_single_monocle)" = "true" ]
#             then
#                 echo ""
#             else
#                 echo "M"
#             fi
#             ;;
#         *) echo "" ;;
#     esac
# done < <(bspc subscribe report)
