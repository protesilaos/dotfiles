# Description
# ===========
#
# Configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to work with
# `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed with GNU
# Stow.  See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# Most commands are derived from `man bspc|bspwm` and `man sxhkd`.  Each
# action is preceded by comments which explain what it does.

# Index with key chord chain mnemonics
# ====================================
#
# Key chord chains are used for less common or ancillary commands, or
# for when assigning direct keybindings would become unwieldy.  The idea
# is to scope bindings so as to avoid conflicts.  
#
# Environment: super + e ; ...
# Executables which typically run in the console: super + x ; ...
# Graphical applications: super + g ; ...
# Assign (node flags): super + a ; ...
# Split (split ratios): super + s ; ...

# FIXME key chain chords in the form of `super + n ; ...` have a bug See
# https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd/issues/83.  The awkward
# workaround is to use this syntax instead `super + n; X ; ...`, where X
# is a variable.

# General key chords that do not invoke BSPC
# ==========================================

# Keyboard layout
# ---------------
# We can set the keyboard layouts, as well as the toggle directly via
# `setxkbmap`.  Example of what I used to run:
#
#   setxkbmap -layout 'us,gr' -option 'grp:alt_caps_toggle'
#
# However, doing so means losing out on the possibility to easily find
# out the current/active layout from a script: X knows about us,gr in
# that order, not which one is currently typing.  As such, in `bspwmrc`
# I simply autostart `setxkbmap -layout 'us'` without defining the
# second layout and a toggle.  The toggle is set below.  With the
# difference being that it invokes a custom script that switches between
# the us,gr layout.  All this is done to be able to get the active
# keyboard layout and print its name to my system panel (custom lemonbar
# called "melonpanel").

# Environment
# -----------

# The following commands are:
#
# c == toggle compton (display compositor)
# d == dmenu to quickly edit dotfiles
# s == reload sxhkd
# p == reload melonpanel (my lemonbar script)
# t == dmenu to choose Tempus theme
# m == notification with mpc status
# k == switch layout (configured to toggle between US QWERTY and Greek)
# q == dmenu interface to log out, lock, switch users, reboot, shutdown
#
# Recall that these depend on my dotfiles:
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.

# Main programs
# -------------

# Terminal emulator with and without tmux.  I normally use `tmux` which
# is ideal for working on multiple terminals, switching sessions, and
# the like.  You should really give this a fair try.  I think it fits
# perfectly into a console-based workflow and complements the features
# of a tiling WM.
#
# NOTE `@` means until key is released, though I cannot confirm it works
# properly.  It is kept here for reference and future review.

# sbgmenu: dmenu interface for browsing images from my "Pictures"

#
# nbp: similar to the above, but uses a graphical approach, by
# displaying all image thumbnails in a grid layout using `sxiv`.  The
# user can view each image individually and mark images.  If only one is
# marked, it is defined as the new wallpaper, else another grid is drawn
# with just the marked files.
#
# dmenu interface for managing my task list.  If I type something that
# has no match, it is appended in plain text format to my task list
# file.  If I select an existing item, it is removed from the list.
# I also have a script that presents the data: see "stm" inside my
# dotfiles' "bin" directorty

# implementation # in lieu of the actual commands, which assigns the key
# chords I have # specified in `dunstrc`.
