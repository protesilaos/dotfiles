#
# SXHKD module with WM-agnostic keys
#
# Part of my dotfiles: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles>.
#

### Description
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to
# work with `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed
# with GNU Stow.  See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

### Code:

#### Environment


# I am using the prefix `mod4 + e' as a mnemonic for "environment".
#
# The following commands are:
#
# f == bspwm focus mode (my script)
# s == reload sxhkd
# p == reload melonpanel (my lemonbar script)
# x == reload the Xresources file
mod4 + x ; e ; {f,s,p,t,x}
    { \
    bspwm_focus_mode, \
    pkill -USR1 -x sxhkd && notify-send -i key_bindings "Reloaded key bindings", \
    pkill -x melonpanel && melonpanel, \
    xrdb -I "$HOME" -merge "$HOME"/.Xresources \
    }

# Invoke the session management menu (log out, lock, reboot, shutdown).

#### Keyboard layout

# NOTE 2021-08-27: review commentary about layout toggle.

# We can set the keyboard layouts, as well as the toggle directly via
# `setxkbmap`.  Example of what I used to run:
#
#	setxkbmap -layout 'us,gr' -option 'ctrl:nocaps,compose:menu'
#
# However, doing so means losing out on the possibility to easily find
# out the current/active layout from a script: X knows about "us,gr" in
# that order, not which one is currently typing.  As such, in `bspwmrc`
# I simply autostart `setxkbmap -layout 'us'` without defining the
# second layout and a toggle.  The toggle is set below.  With the
# difference being that it invokes a custom script that switches between
# the us,gr layout.  All this is done to be able to get the active
# keyboard layout and print its name to my system panel (custom lemonbar
# called "melonpanel").
#
# The key chord is based on the Emacs function `toggle-input-method',
# which is bound to C-\
mod4 + backslash
	toggle_kbd_layout

#### Main programs

# # Use Xterm as a standalone tool or with Tmux (with Shift).
# mod4 + {_, shift + } Return
# 	{xterm,xterm -e tmux new-session -A -s 'Default'}

# Show the desired rofi views.
mod4 + x ; {x,b}
     rofi -show {drun,window}


#### Miscellaneous tools and media keys


# Screenshots (requires `scrot`).  First one is for the focused window.
# The other is of the entire X session (including all active monitors).
# Note that `scrot` also has an interactive mode that I do not use.

# TODO 2019-11-01: These will need to be reviewed once all key bindings
# are rewritten.  Perhaps it would be nice to produce something that is
# interactive and searchable…
