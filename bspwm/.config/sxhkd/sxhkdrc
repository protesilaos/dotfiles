# SXHKD module with WM-agnostic keys
#
# ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
#

# Description
# ===========
#
# Partial configuration file for the Simple X Hotkey Daemon.  Meant to
# work with `bspwm`.  This is part of my dotfiles, which are managed
# with GNU Stow.  See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

# Index with key chord chain mnemonics
# ====================================
#
# Key chord chains are used for less common or ancillary commands, or
# for when assigning direct keybindings would become unwieldy.  The idea
# is to scope bindings so as to avoid conflicts.  
#
# Environment: super + e ; ...
# Executables which typically run in the console: super + x ; ...
# Graphical applications: super + g ; ...
# Assign (node flags): super + a ; ...
# Split (split ratios): super + s ; ...



# Keyboard layout
# ---------------
# We can set the keyboard layouts, as well as the toggle directly via
# `setxkbmap`.  Example of what I used to run:
#
#   setxkbmap -layout 'us,gr' -option 'grp:alt_caps_toggle'
#
# However, doing so means losing out on the possibility to easily find
# out the current/active layout from a script: X knows about us,gr in
# that order, not which one is currently typing.  As such, in `bspwmrc`
# I simply autostart `setxkbmap -layout 'us'` without defining the
# second layout and a toggle.  The toggle is set below.  With the
# difference being that it invokes a custom script that switches between
# the us,gr layout.  All this is done to be able to get the active
# keyboard layout and print its name to my system panel (custom lemonbar
# called "melonpanel").

# Environment
# -----------

# The following commands are:
#
# c == toggle compton (display compositor)
# d == dmenu to quickly edit dotfiles
# f == bspwm focus mode
# s == reload sxhkd
# p == reload melonpanel (my lemonbar script)
# t == dmenu to choose Tempus theme
# m == notification with mpc status
# k == switch layout (configured to toggle between US QWERTY and Greek)
# q == dmenu interface to log out, lock, switch users, reboot, shutdown
#
# Recall that these depend on my dotfiles:
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.

# Main programs
# -------------

# Terminal emulator with and without tmux.  I normally use `tmux` which
# is ideal for working on multiple terminals, switching sessions, and
# the like.  You should really give this a fair try.  I think it fits
# perfectly into a console-based workflow and complements the features
# of a tiling WM.
#
# NOTE `@` means until key is released, though I cannot confirm it works
# properly.  It is kept here for reference and future review.

# GUI programs.  Where these are alternatives to common CLI tools they
# are mapped to the same number as their counterparts, but prepended
# with a `g` (mnemonic for GUI).

# CLI programs.  Any browser and/or file manager should be assigned the
# numbers 1 and 2 respectively, in order to keep consistency with the
# above-defined GUIs.
#
# Note that, by default, all instances of `mate-terminal` run in
# a single process.  So killing one (bspc node -k), will bring down all
# terminals.  Pass option "--disable-factory" to run each terminal as
# its own process (I only do this for special occasions, as seen
# elsewhere in this file).
super + x ; {3-5}
    mate-terminal --disable-factory -x {neomutt,newsboat,ncmpcpp}

# I use "my_float_window" as an application name or class for those rare
# occasions where I prefer a floating window at launch.  The option
# --disable-factory is necessary to run the terminal in its own process,
# so as to inherit the class we pass to it.
#
# Note that `calc` is found in the Debian repos as `apcalc`.

# sbgmenu: dmenu interface for browsing images from my "Pictures"
# directory.  There is an option to just display the selected file, or
# set it as the new desktop wallpaper.
#
# nbp: similar to the above, but uses a graphical approach, by
# displaying all image thumbnails in a grid layout using `sxiv`.  The
# user can view each image individually and mark images.  If only one is
# marked, it is defined as the new wallpaper, else another grid is drawn
# with just the marked files.
#
# dmenu interface for managing my task list.  If I type something that
# has no match, it is appended in plain text format to my task list
# file.  If I select an existing item, it is removed from the list.
# I also have a script that presents the data: see "stm" inside my
# dotfiles' "bin" directorty
#
# NOTE the keys are mnemonics for Backgrounds, Wallpapers, Tasks.

# Tools and utilities
# -------------------

# PLACEHOLDER for future release of dunst

# # TODO add all `dunst` related keys here.  Currently, it only supports
# # setting key bindings inside `dunstrc`, but there is ongoing work to
# allow an # external program to handle them.  Below is an example
# implementation # in lieu of the actual commands, which assigns the key
# chords I have # specified in `dunstrc`.

# # super + {_, shift + } v
    # # VIEW {context menu of} last notification (shows max 3 at a time)
# # super + {_, shift + } c
    # # CLOSE {all} notification{s}

# Screenshots (requires `scrot`).  First one is for the focused window.
# The other is of the entire X session (including all active monitors).
# Note that `scrot` only has an interactive mode that I do not use.
