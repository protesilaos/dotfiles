# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE USE OF MOD3 (written on 2019-10-19)             #
#                                                                          #
# Earlier versions of my SXHKD-related files would use Super (mod4) as the #
# main modifier key for controlling my custom BSPWM session.  However,     #
# since early July 2019 I have switched my main computing/coding/writing   #
# environment to Emacs, where the Super key is more useful there.  As      #
# such, I am now including an `~/.Xmodmap' file which enables the Hyper    #
# key (mod3) and binds it to the Caps lock and the right "Win" key         #
# respectively.                                                            #
#                                                                          #
# Please be very careful with the syntax of the key bindings for SXHKD.    #
# My tests would only yield the desired results when `mod3' was            #
# referenced explicitly.  Writing `hyper' would mess things up with        #
# `super'.                                                                 #
#                                                                          #
# At any rate, this change is likely to be the first in a series as I      #
# try to blend my BSPWM with my Emacs setup.  Eventually, I will make      #
# the key bindings that control the window manager behave more like        #
# those of Emacs and/or I will review all key chord chain to be more       #
# aligned with Emacs conventions.  This is meant to prevent me from the    #
# friction that context-switching tends to cause.                          #

# Close {or kill} currently focused node

# Focus/swap nodes/desktops
# -------------------------

# Focus the node in the given direction.
mod3 + {h,j,k,l}
	bspc node -f {west,south,north,east}

# Swap focused window with the one in the given direction.  If there is
# no window in that direction, a receptacle will be created.  Inputting
# any direction again will move the focused window to the position of
# the receptacle.  This will effectively remove it from the current
# layout, creating a more fluid workflow that does not constrain you to
# the tree of the tiling scheme.
#
# IF you only ever want to move a window into an existing one and avoid
# the added features of the scripted behaviour, use the following
# command instead:
#
# 	bspc node -s {west,south,north,east}
#
# TIP after breaking free from the layout, you can use --balance to
# spread out the nodes (see the key chord further down).  You may also
# --rotate the tree.
#
# bspwm_smart_move is part of my dotfiles (link in the description).

# Dynamic desktop behaviour:  this invokes a script of mine that
# implements dynamic desktops (see dotfiles).  If the given desktop
# number is missing, it is created on the spot.  Empty desktops are then
# removed automatically.
#
#
# mod3 + <number> = focus the given desktop
# mod3 + shift + <number> = send focused window to given desktop
# mod3 + ctrl + shift + <number> = as above, but send to next monitor
# mod3 + ctrl + <number> = switches the active (visible) desktop of the
# unfocused monitor, without focusing it (focus stays on the current
# desktop/monitor).  It also inserts a receptacle, meaning that the next
# created window will go there without calling focus to itself (see my
# bspwm_external_rules).
#
#
# Commands for receptacles are defined in the "advanced operations"
# section.
#
# NOTE the leading `;` runs this command asynchronously.

# Set the node flags.  Locked is a node that cannot be closed with `bspc

# preselection).  Sticky stays in the focused desktop.  Private tries to
# keep its dimensions and tiling position.

# Continuous input mode
# =====================
# EXPLAIN: The following key chords have a colon sign `:' before their
# last part.  By pressing the keys to the left of the colon, you can
# then pass the commands by only using the keys to the right of the
# colon.  This eliminates the need for repeated chord presses that
# involve the modifier keys.  Exit the mode with "Escape".
#
# NOTE: All of the following are mirrors of their afore-mentioned
# couterparts.

# Resize node in the given direction.
mod3 + c : {h,j,k,l}
