# ptp (Print Tempus Palette) --- Prints the colour palette of the active
# Tempus theme and colourises the value of each point accordingly.  Part
# of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.
# 
# The Tempus themes is a standalone project of mine, which is also
# integrated into my custom desktop session.  For more about it, see:
# https://protesilaos.com/tempus-themes.
#
# NOTE ABOUT THE OUTPUT: on terminals that use a dark Tempus theme, the
# colours 0 and 8 will not be visible (maybe colour 8 will be bearely
# visible).  Similarly, colours 7 and 15 will not appear on light
# themes.

# This will work if the colours are in place (my dots rely on GNU Stow).
