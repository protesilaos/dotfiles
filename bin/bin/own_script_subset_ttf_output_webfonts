# Description {{{
# ---------------
#
# This is "alpha" quality.  I still need to apply logic for testing the
# presence of the appropriate files, figure out a better way to handle
# the context of where this script is run from, etc.
#
# For now, this script should be run inside a directory that contains
# font files using the TrueType format, denoted by the `.ttf` extension.
#
# What this does:
# 1. Remove all glyphs that are not part basic latin and greek subsets,
#    the latin1-supplement, numerals and punctuation marks.
# 2. Output the result in `.woff` and `.woff2` files, which are suited
#    for use on the web.
#
# For the complete Unicode character table and code points, see this page:
# https://unicode-table.com
#

# This function accepts two arguments.  The first is the name of the ttf
# file without the file type extension.  The second is the desired
# output format (woff|woff2).  These are provided by the subsequent
# loop.
