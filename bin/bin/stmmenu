# A simple way to manage my task lisk.  `stmmenu` is a dmenu interface
# for adding or removing items from a plain text file.  This script is
# part of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# Adapted from the same tool provided by suckless.org:
# https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/scripts/todo
#
# For a command line utility with more functions and prettier output,
# which interfaces with the exact same task list file, see my `stm`.  It
# is also part of my dotfiles (inside the bin directory).

# Define my task list file
if [ -f "$HOME/.my_task_list" ]; then
	task_list="$HOME/.my_task_list"

	touch -h "$HOME/.my_task_list"
	task_list="$HOME/.my_task_list"
