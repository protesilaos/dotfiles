## Commentary:
#
# The idea with dynamic desktops is to maintain a list of varying
# lengths with only the active items.  Whereas the default is to keep a
# fixed list of, say, ten desktops at all times.
#
# What this script does, in outline:
#
# - Switching to a non-existent desktop will create it dynamically.
# - Sending a node to a given desktop will create that desktop as well.
#   - There also exists a variant that follows the node to that desktop.
# - Empty desktops are removed.
#
# This script's commands are meant to be implemented in SXHKD (or
# equivalent).  Furthermore, the desktops need to be set to one per
# monitor in bspwmrc (empty desktops are removed upon invoking one of
# this script's commands).
#
# `bspwm_dynamic_desktops' is part of my dotfiles (which also offer a
# complete implementation): https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles



# See the --options below for the available arguments for $1.  $2 must
# be a number from 0 to 9.
[ "$#" -eq 2 ] || { echo 'Must be run with two arguments.'; exit 1; }

# Capture the arguments.  We need to run tests against them.  Renaming
# them makes things easier to read.

# The `dynamic_but_dedicated' switch allows us to specify a range of
# numbered desktops that we would always want to place on dedicated
# monitors.  This means that while we retain the functionality of
# dynamically creating/removing desktops, we also bind certain desktops
# to monitors.
#
# THIS IS JUST A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT.  It only applies to the `--ns*'
# options (see the last part of the script).  As such, you can still
# send a node to any dynamically-created numbered desktop on the
# next monitor, by using the `--nm*' options.

# Switch to `false' to restore the monitor-independent behaviour.
