# Simple Background Menu: sbgmenu is a dmenu interface for viewing
# images and/or selecting a new wallpaper from the user's "Pictures"
# directory.  This script is part of my dotfiles and is primarily
# intended for use in my custom BSPWM session:
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# Dependencies on Debian Buster:
# 	sudo apt install suckless-tools
#
# For BSPWM sessions, you also need:
# 	sudo apt install feh
#
# Optional dependency (binary is fdfind):
# 	sudo apt install fd-find
#
# Assign this script to a key binding for your convenience.

# TODO is "Pictures" automatically localised?
# TODO consider adding notify-send actions

# pass custom colours to dmenu command
source "$HOME/.my_colours/active-tempus-theme.sh"

# get the system-wide custom font
source "$HOME/.my_custom_ui_font.sh"

# the customised `dmenu` command.  Accepts the prompt's text as the
# first argument and the height as a second.  If the latter is not
# defined, then dmenu displays options horizontally.
