# A dmenu script to edit predefined files.
# Opens an editor to the file path.
# This implementation works with dotfiles. Could be arbitrary files.

# The full paths are manually included in a plain text file.
# One path per line, starting with the 'label' we want to display in the menu.
# Examples: 
# Bspwm /home/USERNAME/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
# Tmux Keybindings /home/USERNAME/.tmux/keybindings.conf

# XXX NOTE this is a working demo that is tailored to my custom setup
# PREREQUISITES
# All of my dotfiles (stow everything)
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

# path to dotfiles index
mydotsindex="$HOME/.mydotsindex"

# define length of dotfiles' list (for use in dmenu -l)
mydotsindex_length=$(cat $mydotsindex | wc -l)

# gets the list with the file paths
# keeps only the first part which is the path's label
# that keeps the dmenu interface clean
