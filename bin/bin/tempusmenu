# Description {{{
# ---------------
#
# This is a `dmenu` script to switch between Tempus themes on demand.
# It parses the list of available options and presents them once
# invoked.  The choice then becomes the input/argument of another script
# that actually performs the operations pertaining to the complete theme
# change.  In other words, `tempusmenu` is an interface for
# `own_script_update_environment_theme`, both of which are part of my
# dotfiles and are available in the "bin" directory.  See
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles (a short demo should also be
# linked to in the README.md).
#
# Tempus is a collection of themes for Vim and terminal emulators that
# is compliant *at minimum* with the WCAG AA standard for colour
# contrast between background and foreground values.  See
# https://protesilaos.com/tempus-themes.
#
# Tempus is incorporated in my dotfiles, providing for all theme-related
# options it has ports for or can be implemented in.  The theme change
# applies to a variety of programs, including X resources, bspwm, dunst,
# polybar, etc.  A fully functional environment derived from my dotfiles
# is required for this to work as intended.

# General variables {{{

# the output, stripping it of surrounding text. As for `sort`, it just
# presents the output in alphabetical order.

# Pass custom colours to the `dmenu` command.  These will style the
# background and foreground values using shell variables.  That file is
# used in other places as well to offer a convenient way of styling
# multiple tools in a that is centralised and straightforward.

# scripts as well to provide for an easy way to style them all at once.

# Functions and conditions {{{
# ----------------------------

# This is the `dmenu` wrapper with the list of available Tempus themes.
# Instead of offering a direct input source that yields an immediate
# result, this command stores the user's choice as a variable which is
# used further below.

    # This checks if the input is an empty string.  An empty string can
    # be added by hitting the Esc key.  It fixes a critical bug where
    # `own_script_update_environment_theme` would be executed without
    # matching an item in the Tempus Themes array.  This would cause
    # theme files to be replaced by an empty/invalid string.  The
    # necessary logic has been added to that script to tackle the issue.
