# Description and overview {{{
# ----------------------------
#
# Simplistic Task Manager: a shell script that uses standard UNIX tools
# to control the presentation and contents of a plain text file that
# serves as a task list.
#
# My task list is just a plain text file with one task/sentence per
# line.  There are no fancy formats, no complex dependencies.  STM is
# flexible because it does not enforce a specific method for writing
# tasks.  That is left up to the user's discretion.
#
# The way I define tasks is as follows:
#
# * Each line holds a task
# * Each task starts with a majuscule
# * There is no formal markup, but:
# 	- A task's project/context/category is @context
#	- Tag[s] are #tag or #tag1,tag2
#	- Date is =YYYY-MM-DD
# * The task's description always comes first
# * Markup is optional and follows in this order: @ # =
#
# Example of a fully marked-up task:
#
# 	Review code @dotfiles #scripts,stm =2019-02-15
#
# This script is part of my dotfiles:
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# For a dmenu interface to adding/removing tasks to the same to-do list,
# see my stmmenu, which is also part of my dotfiles (inside the "bin"
# directory).

# Global variables {{{
# --------------------

# Define my task list file.
#
# PRO TIP create your task list in a git-controlled directory (so as not
# to lose things by accident) and then symlink it to the target defined
# below:
#	ln -s /path/to/git/directory/my_task_list ~/.my_task_list
if [ -e "$HOME/.my_task_list" ]; then
	task_list="$HOME/.my_task_list"
else
	touch -h "$HOME/.my_task_list"
	task_list="$HOME/.my_task_list"
fi

# colour definitions for the output: ANSI sequences
my_red='\033[31m'
my_green='\033[32m'
my_yellow='\033[33m'
my_blue='\033[34m'
my_magenta='\033[1;35m'
my_cyan='\033[1;36m'
