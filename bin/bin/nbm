# Description {{{
# ---------------
#
# Nimble Backdrop Manager. Interface with `sxiv` to view your Pictures
# folder and set a new wallpaper (by marking the thumbnail with "m" and
# then hitting quit "q").
#
# This script is part of my dotfiles and is primarily intended for use
# in my custom BSPWM session.  However, this script can be run in GNOME,
# MATE, and Xfce to set the wallpaper accordingly.
#
# My dots: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
# 
# Dependencies on Debian Buster:
# 	apt install feh suckless-tools sxiv
#
# Assign this script to a key binding for your convenience.
#
# TODO is "Pictures" automatically localised?
#
# }}}

# Image viewer parameters {{{
# ---------------------------
#
# Define the sxiv command with reading from stdin and delivering to
# stdout.  Start the program in thumbnail mode.  The -N flag is for
# setting a window name that is recognised by my BSPWM rules: makes the
# window float by default.
my_sxiv() {
	sxiv -iot -N 'my_float_window'
}

# }}}

# Query the Pictures folder and present images {{{
# ------------------------------------------------

# Get image files that end in .{jpg,jpeg,png} from ~/Pictures.
find_pictures() {
	find $HOME/Pictures -type f \( -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.jpeg' -o -iname '*.png' \)
}

# Abort if find returns no results.  Else keep on with the script.
if [ -z "$(find_pictures)" ]; then
	echo "ERROR. No valid image files in $HOME/Pictures"
	echo "Aborting..."

# Apply the wallpaper {{{
# -----------------------

# This is the command that sets the wallpaper, which it reads as the
# first argument.  The commands for the desktop environment's listed
# below are standard ways of doing things.  Whereas there is no such
# thing for BSPWM, where I always place my wallpaper as a hidden file in
# my home directory.

		# Copy the selected image to the home directory, as a hidden
