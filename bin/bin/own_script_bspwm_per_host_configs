# Configure `bspwm` depending on the host computer. Part of my dotfiles.
# See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# This script implements some important settings, such as the number of
# workspaces.  The reason these are not defined in `bspwmrc` is to keep
# things clean and organised.  Also, this is better for testing
# purposes.  It has been proven more difficult to debug various
# scripting patterns when they are embedded directly in the `bspwmrc`
# file.
#
# The approach followed herein is largely simplistic because I know the
# setup in advance. I deploy my dotfiles on two separate machines.  On
# one I often run a dual monitor setup.  As such, there are some bespoke
# configs for each host.
#
# }}}

# I define my host names as BASH variables in this file.  The format is
# `my_variable='my_value'`.  Then I source it to retrieve the value I
# need.  This makes it possible to run commands depending on the
# computer you are working on.

# way to see if I have 2 monitors or not.  On the desktop, which is my

# advance.
