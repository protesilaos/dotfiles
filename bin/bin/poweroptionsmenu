# Description {{{ ---------------
#
# A dmenu script to provide an interface for selecting session actions:
# lock, logout, switch users, reboot, poweroff.
#
# This script is intended to be used in a BSPWM session.  As such, the
# log out option uses a BSPWM-specific command.  Part of my dotfiles:
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
#
# Debian Buster dependencies:
# 	
# 	apt install suckless-tools libnotify-bin
